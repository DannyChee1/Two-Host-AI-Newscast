00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
<v Ben>Hey hey, welcome back! We've got some juicy stories to dive into today.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.800
<v Jerry>Yeah, definitely. Starting with the ongoing Disney and YouTube TV drama. It's heating up!

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Ben>Right, and it's wild because Disney's trying to play the underdog here [src: 0].

4
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Jerry>But according to some polls, YouTube might actually have the upper hand [src: 0].

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.200
<v Ben>Okay, let’s jump right in. What's the latest with Disney and YouTube TV?

6
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Jerry>So Disney's been in a contract standoff with YouTube TV. They've been trying to rally public support by painting themselves as the underdog [src: 0].

7
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Ben>Underdog? Disney? That's a new angle.

8
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Jerry>Right? But the thing is, despite their efforts, polling suggests YouTube might actually be winning the PR battle [src: 0].

9
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Ben>Interesting. You know, it's kind of like David versus Goliath, but where Goliath is pretending to be David.

10
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Jerry>Exactly. And with the reach of YouTube, they're able to counteract Disney's narrative pretty effectively.

11
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800
<v Ben>So what's at stake here?

12
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Jerry>It's all about contract negotiations, really. If they can't find common ground soon, customers might take the hit, losing access to Disney content on YouTube TV [src: 0].

13
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Ben>Man, negotiations in this industry are never straightforward, are they?

14
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.800
<v Jerry>Nope, and it's always the consumers who get caught in the crossfire.

15
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.200
<v Ben>Alright, what's next on our list?

16
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Jerry>Next up is the Zero Gravity Summit in Salt Lake City [src: 1].

17
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Ben>Oh, I love this stuff. Tech, innovation, and all that good future-y stuff.

18
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Jerry>It's a big event, bringing together policymakers and innovators to discuss dual-use technology and national security [src: 1].

19
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Ben>And dual-use, meaning tech that's good for both civilian and military applications, right?

20
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Jerry>Exactly. They're focusing on energy and flight this year [src: 1].

21
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Ben>Energy and flight, huh? That’s a killer combo.

22
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Jerry>Yeah, and they’re exploring how these innovations can shape the future of national security [src: 1].

23
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Ben>Super fascinating. I mean, it's exactly what we need to be looking into right now.

24
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Jerry>Absolutely. These are the kind of conversations that determine where the technology is headed.

25
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.600
<v Ben>Now, let's talk about the trillion-dollar pay package for Elon Musk. Can you believe it?

26
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.600
<v Jerry>I was just about to say—Tesla's shareholders approved it, and it's honestly mind-boggling [src: 2].

27
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Ben>Yeah, but here's the thing—it's not just a regular salary, right?

28
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.600
<v Jerry>Right, it’s structured as this massive incentive package tied to Tesla's performance [src: 2].

29
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Ben>So basically, if Tesla performs, he gets paid, big time.

30
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.800
<v Jerry>Exactly. But it makes you wonder about the messaging there. Like, should a CEO really earn that much?

31
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.600
<v Ben>I mean, he's betting on himself and Tesla's future. That's pretty bold.

32
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Jerry>Bold, but it also brings up questions about income disparity and corporate ethics [src: 2].

33
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.200
<v Ben>For sure. It's a complex issue, no easy answers.

34
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.000
<v Jerry>Speaking of complexity, let's touch on how Celonis is helping CIE with their ERP systems [src: 4].

35
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
<v Ben>ERP? Enterprise Resource Planning, right?

36
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Jerry>That's the one. CIE Automotive needed to streamline their ERP for better operational clarity [src: 4].

37
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.200
<v Ben>And Celonis is like the fixer here?

38
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Jerry>Pretty much. They're helping to integrate and manage CIE’s core business processes [src: 4].

39
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Ben>That's got to be a huge relief for CIE.

40
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Jerry>For sure. It allows them to operate with more clarity and efficiency.

41
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Ben>Okay, wrapping up with the Elon Musk trillion-dollar messiah angle from The Irish Times [src: 3].

42
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Jerry>It's funny how they called him that, but there's also concern about his political stances impacting Tesla's profits [src: 3].

43
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.200
<v Ben>I know, right? It’s like celebrity CEO meets controversy.

44
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.800
<v Jerry>Yeah, and the consumer backlash is real [src: 3].

45
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.600
<v Ben>Tesla is definitely navigating tricky waters here.

46
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.400
<v Jerry>Absolutely, and it's one more reason why corporate leadership needs careful balancing.

47
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.000
<v Ben>Alright, that's our rundown.

48
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Jerry>Hope you enjoyed digging into these stories with us.

49
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.600
<v Ben>Catch you next time, folks!
